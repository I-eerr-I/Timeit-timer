Simple windows timer for timeouts tracking. Created using Windows Forms App (.NET Framework).
It is designed to be very simple, minimalistic timer to track timeouts. One of the ways to use it is pomodoro timer. I've developed it for own purpose to track display time, be distracted from a computer in time to relax my eyes. 
It's main features:
- Fades out to minimum opacity, with the app being unfocused, to be almost unnoticeable and not distracting
- Sends notification on timeout.
- Checks amount of timeouts.
- Has a minimal set of features of a standard timer.
